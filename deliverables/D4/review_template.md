### Project Name: Savi Finance
### Team Name, Team Number: Group9, Team 9
### Github Link: [Link](https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/9-savi-finance)

### Project Summary:
An App to track activity across all crypto wallets, it inteneds to compete with others by directly reading from the blockchain instead of using third party API's to reduce costs.

### Introduction & Overview of the problem and the product:
_* Were you able to understand clearly the problem that the project is trying to solve?_
Yes, the project aims to provide a solution for users to centralize their crypto balances and activities from various wallets efficiently.

_* Were you able to get an overview of what the project is about?_
Yes, the project overview provided a clear understanding of its objectives and functionalities.

_* Were you able to differentiate what the project does and how it differs from existing or prior work?_
Yes, the project distinguishes itself by reading directly from the blockchain, offering cost reduction and broader support for crypto wallets compared to existing solutions.
_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_
How cryptocurreny works.

### Demo of the application:
_* Were the ideas presented in the demo clear and easy to understand?_
Yes, the demo effectively communicated the application's features.

_* Did the team demonstrate all the key features of their application in the demo?_
I don't believe they demonstrated how the "Add new account" feature works, it seems like they changed their idea displayed in their documents which was to connect via different wallets into simply putting a wallet address?

_* Did the demo help you in forming a good understanding of the application?_
Yes, the demo provided a comprehensive understanding of the application's functionalities.

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_
I believe there is a bug with the balance display, inputting in 1$ as a new account displays 100$ for the graph. Also, it seems that the graph starts on the current day, so how can there be any historical data? In the documentation, you also used a float for the balance, so wouldn't the graph always be a straight line?

### Technical Discussion & Key Learnings:
_* Were you able to understand the technical aspects of the project?_
Yes, the technical aspects were explained clearly.

_* Do the key learnings presented by the team make sense, are concrete and achievable, and will help to improve the project?_
Yes, the key learnings seem concrete and achievable, contributing to project improvement.

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_
Code samples or code repo could provide more insight.

### Project Documentation:
_* Was the project readme easy to follow and gives all the necessary details about the project?_
Yes, the project readme was easy to follow and provided necessary details.

_* For a new user (such as yourself), how approachable and easy is it to read and follow the readme?_
The readme is approachable and easy to understand for new users.

_* Are there technical or major writing errors that prevents a good understanding or leads to confusion?_
No major errors or confusions in the documentation.

_* Do you think there are gaps in the documentation or points that could have improved its quality?_
The documentation focuses primarly on frontend, I would like to see more documentation of the backend and how it is used to fetch data from the blockchain and etc.

### Project Deployment:
_* Were you able to follow the instructions and install the application on your device?_
Yes, the instructions for installation were clear.

_* Did the application run without any errors?_
Yes, the application ran without errors.

_* Were you able to test at least the basic / most significant features of the application?_
Yes, basic features were tested successfully.

_* Were there any edge cases that you feel the application doesn't consider?_
If there are no crypto accounts registered, clicking on the crypto icon on the left sidebar (and the pie graph) causes the screen to turn blank, this seems like a huge edge case that many unsuspecting users will run into. 

_* Is the UI of the application representative of a product similar to this project?_
Yes, the UI seems representative of a similar product.

_* Any points that would have helped to improve this aspect?_
A dark mode to the UI would have helped.

### Misc.:
_* Are there any other points that you want to comment on / give your feedback?_
I liked the UI used in this project, refer to comments in previous segments for feedback.

_* These could be points that were not captured above, but you think will help to improve the product quality._
The help button is a nice feature, it would be cool if you could implement a highlighting system for each slide so it highlights the elements associated with the tip. This could dramatically help user experience and overall understanding of the website/app.
